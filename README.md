# ratchet-cni

An implementation of koko, as a CNI plugin.

Way more to come. Peak at the `how-to.md` to read more about it.

### Behind the name

The name idea comes from the idea of a [ratchet puller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come-A-Long) (aka: a come-a-long). Because in my mind it connects to something at one end, and then on the other end, you can crank on it to hold the pieces where they need to be.
